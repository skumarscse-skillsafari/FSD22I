    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. <br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
        typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <h2>Text Formatting tags</h2>
    <p><b>It</b> is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
        <strong>looking at
            its layout.</strong> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as
        opposed to using <i>'Content here, content here'</i>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing
        packages and web page editors <em>now use Lorem Ipsum </em>as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
        ipsum'
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <u>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
            by
            accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</u>
